 * \section welcome GDevelop Core documentation
 *
 * The **GDevelop Core** library contains the structure of a GDevelop game, classes and tools that are used by the *platforms* and the *GDevelop IDE*.
 *
 * \section gettingstarted Getting started
 *
 * In most cases, you should start by <a href="https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/newIDE/README.md">installing and launching the development version of GDevelop</a>.
 *
 * - If you're interested in writing extensions for GDevelop, read <a href="https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/newIDE/README-extensions.md">the documentation about extensions</a>.
 * - If you want to dig more into how GDevelop is architectured and work on the core, read <a href="https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/Core/GDevelop-Architecture-Overview.md">GDevelop Architecture Overview</a>. Then, you can browse this reference to get more information about a class or function.
 *
 * \section other Other documentations
 *
 * GDevelop is architectured around a `Core` (this library), a game engine (`GDJS`) and extensions (`Extensions` folder). The editor (`newIDE` folder) is using all of these libraries.
