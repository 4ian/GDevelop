 * \section welcome Welcome
 * This is the help file for the "GDevelop JS Platform", which is the **JavaScript code generator** and game engine
 * included in GDevelop.
 *
 * The JS platform is composed of two parts:
 * - The first one is the *C++ part* exposing the platform to the IDE (and this is its documentation).
 * - The second part is the *JavaScript game engine* which is in the *GDJS/Runtime* directory. The documentation of this JavaScript game engine is available [here](../GDJS Runtime Documentation/index.html).
 *
 * If you want to [create extensions for GDevelop, refer to this documentation instead](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/newIDE/README-extensions.md).
