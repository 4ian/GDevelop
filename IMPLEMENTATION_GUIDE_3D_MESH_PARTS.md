# Implementation Guide for 3D Model Mesh Parts Control Feature in GDevelop

## Introduction
The 3D Model Mesh Parts Control feature in GDevelop allows developers to manipulate individual parts of a 3D model. This feature enhances the flexibility and control over 3D assets used in GDevelop projects.

## Requirements
- GDevelop version [Insert version]
- Basic understanding of 3D modeling and GDevelop’s interface
- Required libraries or plugins to be installed

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Project
1. Open GDevelop and create a new project.
2. Ensure that the 3D features are enabled in your project settings.

### Step 2: Importing 3D Models
1. Download or create a 3D model that supports mesh parts.
2. Import the 3D model into your GDevelop project:
   - Navigate to the "Assets" tab.
   - Click on "Import" and select your 3D model file.

### Step 3: Adding Mesh Parts Control
1. Select the imported model in the scene editor.
2. In the properties panel, locate the "Mesh Parts Control" option.
3. Enable the mesh parts control feature.
4. Configure the specific parts you want to control, defining the properties like visibility, material, and transformations (scale, rotation, position).

### Step 4: Scripting Interactions
1. Use GDevelop’s event system to script how users can interact with the mesh parts.
2. Create events that respond to user inputs, allowing for changing, hiding, or showing specific mesh parts on demand.

### Step 5: Testing
1. Run your project to test the functionality of the mesh parts control.
2. Make adjustments as needed based on testing outcomes.

## Conclusion
The Mesh Parts Control feature significantly enhances the capability of developers to create dynamic and interactive 3D experiences within GDevelop. By following this guide, you should be able to implement this feature effectively in your projects.
