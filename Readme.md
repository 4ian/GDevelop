GDevelop is a full-featured, open-source game development software, allowing to create desktop and mobile games without any knowledge in a specific programming language. All the game logic is built up using an intuitive and powerful event-based system.

| `Core`        | GDevelop core library, containing common tools to implement the IDE and work with GDevelop games.     |
| `GDJS`        | The game engine, written in TypeScript, using PixiJS (WebGL), powering all GDevelop games.            |
| `GDevelop.js` | Bindings of `Core`, `GDJS` and `Extensions` to JavaScript (with WebAssembly), used by the IDE.        |
| `newIDE`      | The game editor, written in JavaScript with React, Electron and PixiJS.                               |
| `Extensions`  | Extensions for the game engine, providing objects, behaviors, events and new features.                |
