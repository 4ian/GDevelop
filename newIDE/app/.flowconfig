# Don't type check the GDJS runtime and extensions copied into node_modules (only used for the web-app),
# as this would be redundant for JsExtension.js files (see [include] section) of Extensions, and the
# game engine and extensions are annotated with TypeScript annotations, not Flow.
# It would also force Flow to restart every single time GDJS-for-web-app-only is updated, which is
# almost always during development (any change in GDJS/extensions, or any restart of the app).
