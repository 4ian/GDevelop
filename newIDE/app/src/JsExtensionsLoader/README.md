This directory contains the extension loader for Node.js/Electron (`LocalJsExtensionsLoader`) or the Browser (`BrowserJsExtensionsLoader`).

`LocalJsExtensionsLoader` is loading extensions from GDJS Runtime folder. Be sure to launch `node import-GDJS-Runtime.js`  from `newIDE/app/scripts` if you made any changes in an extension.
